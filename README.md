# React & Tailwind CSS Starter Pack

This is a starter pack for creating React projects with Tailwind CSS and TypeScript configured. It uses React version 19, Tailwind CSS version 3.4.17 and TypeScript 5.7.2.

## Usage

This starter pack includes a basic setup for using Tailwind CSS with React. To start building your own components and styles, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the required packages and start the development server:

```
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```

Open the project in your browser at [localhost](http://localhost:5173) to view your project.

Create your React components and add your styles using Tailwind classes.

The project is set up to use postcss-cli to process your CSS files.

## Commit

The project is also Commitizen friendly. Commitizen formats your commits. Visit [commitizen](https://www.npmjs.com/package/commitizen) for more info.

Install Commitizen locally:

```
$ npm install --save-dev commitizen
```

When you are ready to commit, after having adding your updated files, run the following command:

```
$ npm run commit
```

Should you wish to add to this starter a pre-commit hook such as **husky**, you will have to rename the script, other than "commit".

**HAPPY CODING!**
