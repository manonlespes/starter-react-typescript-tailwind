# 🚀 React & Tailwind CSS Starter Pack

This is a starter pack for creating React projects with Tailwind CSS and TypeScript configured. It uses React version 19, Tailwind CSS version 3.4.17 and TypeScript 5.7.2.

## 📦 How to Use This Template

### **1. Using the GitHub Template Feature (Recommended)**
If you can see **"Use this template"** button 

1. Click on **"Use this template"** on the repository page.
2. Click on **"Create New Repository"**
3. Install the required packages and start the development server:

```
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```

### **2. Manual Cloning & Reinitializing Git**
If you don't see the **"Use this template"** button, you can manually set up a new project:

1. On you local machine, clone the repository into the folder of your choice

```
$ git clone https://github.com/manonlespes/starter-react-typescript-tailwind.git
```

3. Remove the **".git"** and init git again to push to your new repository

```
$ rm -rf .git
$ git init
```
4. Install the required packages and start the development server
```
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```
5. Open the project in your browser at [localhost](http://localhost:5173) to view your project


6. Create your React components and add your styles using Tailwind classes
```
$ git add .
$ npm run commit OR git commit -m "my first commit"
$ git push -u origin main
```

🛠️ The project is set up to use postcss-cli to process your CSS files.

## 🔄 Commit

The project is also Commitizen friendly. Commitizen formats your commits. Visit [commitizen](https://www.npmjs.com/package/commitizen) for more info.

1. Install Commitizen locally

```
$ npm install --save-dev commitizen
```

2. When you are ready to commit, after having adding your updated files, run the following command

```
$ npm run commit
```

Should you wish to add to this starter a pre-commit hook such as **husky**, you will have to rename the script, other than **"commit"**.
